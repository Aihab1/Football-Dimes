### 1. Clone the `Football-Dimes` repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Aihab1/Football-Dimes.git
# cd into server and client one by one and refer .env.example file to create your own .env file for storing environment variables. Please make sure you complete this step before running the application.
```

### 2. Install package dependencies

Open two terminals to run commands parallely.

**First terminal (client):**
```
cd client
npm install
```

**Second terminal (server):**
```
cd server
npm install
```

### 3. Start development servers

Continue where you left off (two terminals opened).

**First terminal (client):**
```
npm start
```

**Second terminal (server):**
```
npm start
```

> Backend server runs on localhost:5000 and the client-side runs on localhost:3000 by default.
